    <h1>Week 3:</h1>
    <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
    <h4>February 28, 2016</h4>
  
    <section class="blog-post">
      <p>
      To begin, the main differences between using classes and ids are that classes can be used on multiple elements to indicate a more global style.  Ids are different in that you should only use an id for one element. That one element is unique, and you should not use that same id on another element, it is not best practice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A few best practices associated with using classes vs. ids are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Classes are <strong>NOT</strong> unique</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If more than one element will require the same style, make it a class</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Ids <strong>ARE</strong> unique</li>
          <ul>
            <li>You know you are calling out one specific element</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Elements can have <strong>BOTH</strong> classes and ids</li>
        <li>Ids can be used to link, classes cannot</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This can be useful to link to a certain part of a page (i.e. a different section)</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Donâ€™t use a class or id if it is not required, it just makes the code heavier</li>
        <li>Classes and ids can be named by your preference, but you should follow a naming convention, and write you code so other developers can interpret it as well</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A common naming convention is <i>lower-case-dashed</i> or the less common, but accepted <i>TitleCase</i></li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
