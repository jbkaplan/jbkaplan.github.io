    <h1>Week 7:</h1>
    <h2>Looping in Ruby vs. Looping in JavaScript</h2>
    <h4>March 27, 2016</h4>
  
    <section class="blog-post">
      <p>
        Looping is pretty essential in programming, and luckily, looping in Ruby vs. JavaScript is somewhat similar, and both use very similar language to accomplish similar tasks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin, there is a difference in that in Ruby, there are quite a few different loops you can use. You can use <code>.times</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>until</code>, <code>loop</code>, <code>each</code>, and so forth. In JavaScript, it is much more limited. In JavaScript, you can only use <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops. The syntax is also a little different, but similar.</p>
  
      <p>Here&#39;s a basic while loop in both Ruby and JavaScript.</p>

      <strong>Ruby:</strong> 
      <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/jbkaplan/acae566779ad20968dd9.js"></script></p>

      <strong>JavaScript:</strong> <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/jbkaplan/93b632891964a4f75c52.js"></script></p>
      
      <p>
        Here, the differences aren&#39;t too major, and they are quite similar. How about another program, here we&#39;ll do a loop in each to count to 12, displaying only the even numbers. Ruby, we can use a few different looping methods, but in this instance, we&#39;ll go with an <code>each</code> method.
      </p>
      <strong>Ruby:</strong> 
      <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/jbkaplan/aa41a9b78cde5009b46c.js"></script></p>

      <strong>JavaScript</strong> 
      <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/jbkaplan/23a05660326324124e3a.js"></script></p>

      <p>
        Here, we can see how different JavaScript and Ruby syntax can be in looping. However, despite the syntax, or multiple ways to achieve a similar solution, both Ruby and JavaScript handle loops similarly, and are essential to both programming languages.
