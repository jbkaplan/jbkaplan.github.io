        Version control has a lot of benefits. Mainly, it provides a history of revisions to your code, and allows us to merge these revisions to a master that should always be working properly. Version control also allows us to revert back to a particular iteration so if we find a bug or a bit of code is not working properly, we can revert back to the iteration of our code that was working properly and see what went wrong and go from there. This makes for easy recovery and tracking. This also helps in organization. Coming in to programming, as a designer, this system is very welcoming. Instead of having to learn a new file-naming structure, and constantly saving and sending new files with different extensions (<strong>ex:</strong> the dreaded file labeled <i>final_USE-THIS-ONE_v2</i>), version control takes care of this for us. Along this same line, instead of having multiple backups of the same code saved on our local computer, we can easily revert back or see the previous iterations of our code.

          Git helps us keep track of our changes this way. Git doesn't automatically save our progress; we have to commit our changes. These commits are our save points, and in doing so we create a new version of the file. To commit your changes, you include a message describing the changes you made so we know what and why we made the change we did. This keeps track of all changes from us or any other developer looking that the directory.
      </p>

          GitHub is a great resource to store our code. For one, it is open source so it allows for collaboration from our developers that can help us build on our code. It hosts our backups of repos in the cloud, keeps our code in one place, and allows us to view a browsable history of changes.
