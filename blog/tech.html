    <h2>Functional Programming</h2>

        Functional programming is the theory and style of programming that looks to describe what you want to do instead of looking at how you want something done. It is using functions, instead of objects or procedures as the building blocks of a program. A key to functional programming is reducing the complexity to real-world programs. Functional programming breaks down problems into lighter, simpler pieces of code that is easier to understand and follow.

        <strong>Two concepts are essential to functional programming</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One, data in functional programming is immutable, meaning that it is never changed. And second, it is stateless, meaning that the program will operate as expected regardless of what occurred earlier in a program's execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        In functional programming, the goal is always to look for simpler, repeatable steps that can be turned into functions, and to make more readable. Programs are executed by evaluating expressions instead of changing states with statements. This main key in functional programming is characterized as having no side effects, which refers to modifying a state. Having no side effects makes a function pure, which is the goal in functional programming, as it depends only on it's input parameters, and returns a result that doesn't change it's state.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all, functional programming is easier to read and understand since it is much simpler, and using less code. In doing so it leads to higher productivity, quicker coding, and easier testing.
