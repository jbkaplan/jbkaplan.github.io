How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was a little different wireframing with a pair. We had a little difference of opinion with the elements we should include, but came to an agreement on working with the same wireframe. After this, writing the HTML page went pretty smooth, and followed our wireframe pretty well.


Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Working with a wireframe was really helpful in the development process. It served as a good visual guide to follow when writing HTML instead of just starting from scratch. It definitely cuts time by thinking through the page at the beginning, instead of going back in forth when you get to the coding part.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

We decided a good wireframe was straightforward and easy to follow. We discussed how we shouldn't obsess over a wireframe since that could take into valuable time to code the page. Wireframes aren't that interactive so spending so much time on small details hurts your project more, and should be left to figure out in the development phase.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

With my previous experience in HTML5, I was already pretty well versed with the semantic elements.
