        Ruby classes are very useful. They are great way for organizing objects. Classes are like a blueprint, they contain methods attached to the class that can be executed. Classes make our methods easier to access, they form hierarcy, and form objects. Think of dice, a die can have 6 sides so when it is rolled, either one of the 6 sides can show up.
      </p>
      <strong>In action, our Dice class can look like this:</strong>
      <p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/jbkaplan/921bfb5017f895170497.js"></script>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Let's break a few things down here.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        First, we have our methods contained in one class <code>Die</code>, this will be our blueprint. We start our class through an <code>initialize</code> method, and here we created that method which takes an argument <code>(sides)</code>. This initialize method is used to receive our argument so that it can begin a method. In our initialize method, we also define an <code>ArgumentError</code> to be brought up if the sides we define on our Die is not > 1, because, well, what's the point in rolling a 1 sided die?!
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, have our <code>roll</code> method which will use a <code>random</code> method to simulate a real rolled die, and return that side.
      </p>
      <p>
        To call our class we start with a variable to define our class <code>die = Die.new(6)</code> (start our method to roll a 6 sided die), and then we can use that to call our other 2 methods for <code>die.sides</code> (return our 6 sides we defined), and <code>die.roll</code> (generate a random roll).
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing to note, we used a <code>attr_accessor :sides</code> to clean up our code. The attr_accessor method takes care of us writing:
      <p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/jbkaplan/2b66c86838cec663d035.js"></script>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can start to see how effective it is to use classes in Ruby! This is just a simple class, but the more complex our problems, and code have to become, classes become that much more useful.
