    <h1>Week 4:</h1>
    <h2>Arrays vs. Hashes</h2>
    <h4>March 6, 2016</h4>

      <p>
        Well, there are a few main differences that really separate the two. Let&#39;s start first with arrays. An array is an ordered list on a computer. Each slot of the array get&#39;s assigned an index value, starting at 0, that corresponds to that variable in the array. For example, if you were to call <code>array[0]</code>, you would get the first variable in the list.  To create an array, you would have a string, float, or integer contained within brackets, as such <code>array = [ &#34;variable&#34;, 123, 1.234, &#34;another variable&#34;]</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hashes, on the other hand, also contain slots of objects, but instead of lists, they contain key-value pairs. This means each value is associated with a key, so instead of looking up a value through it&#39;s index value, like in an array, you would call <code>hash[value]</code>, which would return the key. While arrays contain a collection of data, hashes point to the key or value. To create a new hash we can use: <code>hash = { &#34;key&#34; => &#34;value &#34;, &#34;key&#34; => 123 }</code>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        To recap, arrays and hashes are similar in that contain a collection of data and information. As well, each can be accessed using methods, and you can create methods that manipulate or change the data in an array or hash. The main thing to remember is that if you are using 2 pieces of data (key and value) you should use a hash, or if not, an array works best.
