# What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

In doing this challenge, it really showed the importance of understanding the differences between borders, padding, and margins. With my previous experience with CSS, I was pretty familiar with the properties, this challenge just really reinforced the importance, and terminology for me. 


# What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I had trouble centering my content in a few sections. I learned that in order to set a `margin: auto` such as to center, the width had to be defined. I also had trouble floating objects, and learned that instead of having to do both `float: left` and `float: right` on a different element, I just needed to use one, and the other centent flowed in.


# What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The basic styles (font, size, color) were easiest to implement. The most difficult for me was positioning the elements how I wanted them, and floating objects. I also did not learn enough to implement my contact form, and every button so that was also challenging for me.


# What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that using HTML5 syntax made it a lot easier to add and change CSS styles. It was much easier to target specific elements and tags this way. As well, I learned a lot about centering and using padding, and margins to my advantage after struggling at first. I also learned about adding/floating images, and how to best flow those into my document.
