I am is a software engineer, world traveler, and golf addict. Previously, I was a visual designer in the advertising and marketing industry. I have always loved exploring the relationships between communication, design, and technology. What drew me to development was the ability to build systems, solve complex problems, and connect people through technology.

I'd love to learn more and share ideas with others in my community. Feel free to contact me at [jbkaplan@outlook.com](jbkaplan@outlook.com).
